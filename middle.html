            <p>In the beginning, there was the word. Or maybe it was the glance. Or maybe even the shy smile. I'm not really sure, Mom never told me. Two lost souls bridged the gap between cultures and coasts to unite in what might be described as love, at least for the first bit. Vows were made, two flesh became one, and then two, and then three, and then four. Vows were broken, along with hearts, and one of the lost souls drifted away. Is this the end? Or the beginning?</p>

            <p>One of those fleshes grew up. There was tragedy and there was comedy. Long periods of confusion punctuated by brief moments of clarity. When I was about eight years old I was living with my father, step-mother, a half brother, a step brother, a half sister, an adopted sister, a step sister, a whole sister, and two whole brothers. I remember very clearly thinking that if my father continued to act the way he did, one day we would all move away and he would grow old and alone. Over two decades later, and my prediction has been proven painfully true.</p>

            <p>Inside me is buried a deep and abiding drive to prove that choice is real, and circumstance is temporary. There is context to all of us, and all that we are. We can never escape context, but the choices that we make are made more meaningful, more beautiful, or more tragic by that context. The family that I have now, my family, is beautiful. Every choice I make to be a better father and husband is magnified by the juxtaposition of the lessons I learned as a child. Is this the middle? Or the end?</p>
