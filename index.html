        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Prologue</h1>
          <p>Every story has a beginning, middle, and end, but this arrangement can be a little more complicated then you might realize.  One of the most important choices any storyteller makes is where to begin the story. To quote one of the great poets of the late 90s, every beginning is some other beginning's end.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Beginning</h2>
          <p>In the beginning, there was the word. Or maybe it was the glance. Or maybe even the shy smile. I'm not really sure, Mom never told me. Two lost souls bridged the gap between cultures and coasts to unite in what might be described as love, at least for the first bit. Vows were made, two flesh became one, and then two, and then three, and then four. Vows were broken, along with hearts, and one of the lost souls drifted away. Is this the end? Or the beginning?</p>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Middle</h3>
          <p>One of those fleshes grew up. There was tragedy and there was comedy. Long periods of confusion punctuated by brief moments of clarity. When I was about eight or nine years old I was living with my father, step-mother, a half brother, a step brother, a half sister, an adopted sister, a step sister, a whole sister, and two whole brothers. I remember very clearly thinking that if my father continued to act the way he did, one day we would all move away and he grow old and be alone. Over two decades later, and my prediction has been proven painfully true.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;">End</h4>
          <p>Inside me is buried a deep and abiding drive to prove that choice is real, and circumstance is temporary. There is context to all of us, and all that we are. We can never escape context, but the choices that we make are made more meaningful, more beautiful, or more tragic by that context. The family that I have now, my family, is beautiful. Every choice I make to be a better father and husband is magnified by the juxtaposition of the lessons I learned as child. Is this the middle? Or the end?</p>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Epilogue</h5>
          <p>My story began long before me, and it will continue long after me. My children each carry a piece of my heart and mind with them wherever they go. Sometimes, when they say something to me, I can hear my own words echoing back. Sometimes this makes me very happy; sometimes I can't help but be ashamed. My hope is that they will honor me. That they will remember the best parts and forgive the worst.</p>
