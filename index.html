        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Prologue</h1>
        <p>Every story has a beginning, middle, and end, but this arrangement can be a little more complicated then you might realize.  One of the most important choices any storyteller makes is where to begin the story. To quote one of the great poets of the late 90s, every beginning is some other beginning's end.</p>

        <p>My story began long before me, and it will continue long after me. My children each carry a piece of my heart and mind with them wherever they go. Sometimes, when they say something to me, I can hear my own words echoing back. Sometimes this makes me very happy; sometimes I can't help but be ashamed. My hope is that they will honor me. That they will remember the best parts and forgive the worst.</p>
